High-stress times like this allow misinformation to spread rapidly, and while it's easy to sit back and accept it, part of being politically aware is finding reputable sources and forming your own opinions. It's important to take steps to educate yourself and choose to act on your morals and beliefs, rather than let someone else do it for you.</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\"It is not enough to not be racist. You must be anti-racist.\"</div><br />\n<p>In the span of 13 words, this quote perfectly argues against most of the opposition towards the Black Lives Matter movement overall. Privilege is not a dirty word. It is an acknowledgment of all the things that have set us apart from other people, and while some may argue the word carries a negative connotation, the only thing that makes it unfavorable is people's view of it. We all have privilege. Having access to technology is a privilege. Having access to schooling is a privilege. Living in America is a privilege. Being educated on the racism black people face every day, rather than experience it first hand, is a privilege. And to be able to sit to the side and watch people fight for their right to live, without engaging at all, is the culmination of that. The important thing about privilege, however, is that we can work towards fixing it. Not by bringing ourselves down, but by building up those who don't experience the little things that set us ahead in life. And one of the ways that you can do that, right now, is by participating in this movement, however you can. Whether you are signing petitions, emailing government officials, making phone calls, or even attending protests yourself, every contribution matters. Another favorite quote of ours is applicable to this situation:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\"No one can do everything, but everyone can do something.\"</div><br />\n<p>Making this issue was an incredibly hard process, because how can you find the words to describe the effects of 400 years of injustice? How can 8 pages summarize the countless unjustified deaths of black people, so many of which have been forgotten? How can we ever describe the absolute pain so many people must feel after losing a loved one, how the TAMS community in itself felt after the loss of our own Prince Jones. There is no way we could make this issue perfect, but we hope that it served its purpose and made you think about how your own privilege ties into where you are in this situation, and how you can actively work to dismantle the system that placed us here. Thank you all so much for reading, and we are so proud of all of you.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Closing Message from the Ballot Execs","author":"Abi Kumar","volume":6,"date":"June 07, 2020","topic":"Editorial","slug":"/ballot-buzz/v06a09"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ballot-buzz/v06a09"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
