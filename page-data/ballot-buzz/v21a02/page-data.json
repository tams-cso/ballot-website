With her addition to the highest court in the country, the court has 6 conservative justices to 2 liberal leaning justices. Barrett will replace now late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died in September. Barrett’s confirmation process was notably short. During her hearings, Barrett refused to answer most questions regarding cases but her previous rulings reveal that she is a constitutional originalist. Her confirmation is notable because it occurred amidst an election something Republicans were against in 2016. By receiving no votes from any Democratic senators, Barrett was the first judge to not receive any opposition support in over 150 years. Only one Republican voted against her confirmation.Because of her confirmation, discussions among Democrats about adding more justices to the supreme court have arisen. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has not committed to packing the court, however, he plans on gathering bipartisan scholars to make recommendations for court reform if elected. Issues like Roe V. Wade or the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act are at the front of Americans’ minds and Barrett has assumed to have opposing opinions with the majority of the country. In addition, the likelihood of election laws coming to court is increased this year, due to the higher reliance on mail-in votes, so Justice Barrett could have an substantial say in the outcome of this year’s presidential election.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"v21a02img\"\n        title=\"v21a02img\"\n        src=\"/static/22b93799df3e5c254c747336c2ed35a2/4b190/v21a02img.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/22b93799df3e5c254c747336c2ed35a2/e07e9/v21a02img.jpg 200w,\n/static/22b93799df3e5c254c747336c2ed35a2/066f9/v21a02img.jpg 400w,\n/static/22b93799df3e5c254c747336c2ed35a2/4b190/v21a02img.jpg 800w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Amy Coney Barrett's Confirmation","author":"Anvitha Reddy","volume":21,"date":"November 01, 2020","topic":"US Politics","slug":"/ballot-buzz/v21a02"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ballot-buzz/v21a02"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
