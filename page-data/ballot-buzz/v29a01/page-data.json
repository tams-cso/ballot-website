He stated that it's time for business in Texas to open 100% and this includes restaurants, sporting events, and concerts. As of a week ago, less than 7% of Texans have been vaccinated, and Abbott hasn't said something about vaccine distribution accelerating.</p>\n<p>In response to the removal of the mask mandate, in general, businesses in Texas are keeping their mask-wearing rules. Wal-Mart and Costco will continue to require masks for employees and customers, and H-E-B will only strongly encourage customers to wear masks in the store.</p>\n<p>Local health experts have encouraged the public to keep wearing masks and social distancing. It's estimated that to reach herd immunity, 75 - 90% of the Texas population will need to be vaccinated. Vaccines have yet to be approved for children under 16, who make up 23% of the population, so continuing to wear a mask is highly recommended.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Mask Mandate Repealed","author":"Temi Akinyoade","volume":29,"date":"March 07, 2021","topic":"US Politics","slug":"/ballot-buzz/v29a01"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ballot-buzz/v29a01"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
