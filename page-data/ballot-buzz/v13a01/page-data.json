These catastrophic explosions injured over 5,000 people and killed over 154. The prime minister, Hassan Diab, stated that the explosions were caused by ammonium nitrate, which was originally purchased for mining. The chemical was left in the port city for close to seven years and arrived from Georgia through Russian ships. Beirut’s mayor stated that the damage costs more than $3 billion and covered the majority of the city including damaging several critical ports.</p>\n<p>With COVID-19 surging in Lebanon, hospitals are struggling to treat both coronavirus patients and the victims of the Beirut explosions. Along with the accident earlier this week, Lebanon faces several economic crises including hyperinflation and high unemployment rates. The country also faces severe political unrest due to a corrupt government.</p>\n<p>Since the explosions, protests have taken to the parliament demanding a change in political structure, starting with the removal of the top political leaders. But protests have been occurring for several years. Citizens have stood up against the corrupt class and economic system that have left thousands of people in poverty. Since the government doesn’t listen to petitions, the best way to help the citizens of Lebanon is donating to local organizations and spreading awareness.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Crisis in Lebanon","author":"Anvitha Reddy","volume":13,"date":"August 09, 2020","topic":"International News","slug":"/ballot-buzz/v13a01"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ballot-buzz/v13a01"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
