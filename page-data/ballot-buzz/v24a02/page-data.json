He was given a card with braille names for each category before the rounds and provided with a braille keyboard to type his name and final wager. In addition, all video clues were banned and the tradition of walking up to the podium was changed to contestants simply standing at the podium in the beginning. Eddie ended up winning five games until he retired undefeated and Alex Trebek won one of six annual Access Awards for his work in making <em>Jeopardy!</em> accessible.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>He has his own private charity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alex Trebek formed the Trebek Family Foundation in 2011 with his wife Jean, so that he could help more charities.
