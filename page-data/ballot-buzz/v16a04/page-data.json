He was known in his personal life as a peaceful yet powerful person, standing up against injustices and using his platform to advocate for others, regardless of their position in the world.</p>\n<p>Boseman passed away of stage 4 colon cancer after a 4 year battle with it, during which he created 10 movies that will leave a lasting impact on our world. The news of his death hit many close to home, as Boseman and his roles impacted many lives and were seen as a hallmark to many black people in the movement for equality.</p>\n<p>Our thoughts and prayers are with Boseman's family and friends, as well as anyone impacted by his passing. Our hearts are with you.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Remembering Chadwick Boseman","author":"Abi Kumar","volume":16,"date":"August 30, 2020","topic":"Entertainment","slug":"/ballot-buzz/v16a04"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ballot-buzz/v16a04"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
