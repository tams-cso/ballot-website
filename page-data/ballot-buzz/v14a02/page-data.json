Harris, once a competitor for the Democratic nomination, will have another chance at the White House in a potential Biden administration. If elected, Harris would be the first female, Asian-American, and first African-American vice-president in US History.</p>\n<p>Within a week of the announcement, polls are already showing that voters approve of the choice, with a Morning Consult poll showing a 53% to 29% split for approval vs. disapproval, and an Ipsos survey showing a 44% to 29% split. In the Morning Consult poll, Harris receives majority approval from every age category except 45-64 year olds. Though these preliminary results may not hold through election day, Harris’ racial background could potentially cause an increase in Indian and Black voters for Biden.</p>\n<p>Harris’ track record as a prosecutor and district attorney poses some challenges for the Biden campaign; although it could draw in voters who are concerned about crime and law enforcement, her toughness against minor offenses and wrongfully convicted men of color could also alienate some core Democratic voters. However, in recent years, she has become a leading voice for police reform, speaking out against the recent wrongful police killings of Black civilians and co-authoring a Senate bill that would ban chokeholds. Other notable policy positions she has taken include marijuana legalization, ending minimum mandatory criminal sentences, and eliminating private prisons.</p>\n<p>Some progressives believe Harris is not progressive enough, mostly due to her fluctuating support for Medicare for All and her challenge to the ending of the death penalty in California. But although she has taken a more moderate stance on healthcare and other issues, Harris is a big supporter of climate change action, co-writing the Climate Equity bill, which is billed as a part of the Green New Deal. She is also an advocate for undocumented immigration citizenship, abortion right, and LGBTQ equality.</p>\n<p>Kamala Harris brings a new energy to the Biden campaign, and her announcement comes at a time when many are calling for more minority representation in politics. She is well liked by voters of all ages, races, and political affiliations. Regardless of the outcome on November 3rd, she is making history in her candidacy for vice-president.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Biden-Harris Campaign","author":"Mihir Khare","volume":14,"date":"August 16, 2020","topic":"2020 Presidential Election","slug":"/ballot-buzz/v14a02"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ballot-buzz/v14a02"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
