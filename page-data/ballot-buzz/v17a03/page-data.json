Mental health has always been relevant in society at large, but as self-isolation continues on, it's importance has only increased. Thus, now more than ever, TAMS Active Minds would love to remind you all of the many avenues through which one can seek out help. We believe that nobody should need to struggle alone, and in the era of COVID-19, it has become more of a challenge to reach out to the people whom we'd regularly be only a few feet away from. However, this is in no way impossible, and we plan on ensuring the preservation of the classic TAMS support system any way we can.</p>\n<p>Now that the school year has started, it's easy for us to get lost in the onslaught of schoolwork and the heavy workload that comes with taking university courses, however, having a judgment-free zone to air out any concerns or worries provides a sense of calming relief that can get people focused and back in their headspace. So in order for us to alleviate this stress and further reduce the sense of isolation that comes with online learning, Active Minds is planning monthly Mind Talks (the first one being this next Tuesday!) where you all can openly talk about your experiences and your concerns in a group environment alongside Dr. Turnock, the registered psychologist here at TAMS.</p>\n<p>It's also important to recognize that Dr. Turnock and his assistants are all available to provide their own valuable and experienced insight. You can set up an appointment with him on the TAMS website, and you can schedule a zoom meeting where you can just talk about your concerns! Even if you might worry that whatever you're feeling is \"trivial,\" even just talking about life can help air out any worries that you might have. The Active Minds team strongly recommends y'all go and get to know them, as their insight is always something that can help regardless of your concerns.</p>\n<p>All three of us hope that alongside school work, we're all taking the time to consider our own mental health. Take a break and relax, or just go outside on a walk for a little bit! And definitely keep in mind that help is always there. If y’all have any concerns or questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to any of the Active Minds execs!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sriya, Saathwik and Alexei</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 45.49999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAJABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIEA//EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEE/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAG7ChYqWGB//8QAGhAAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECETEyQv/aAAgBAQABBQLUlcnQ8dn/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEf/aAAgBAwEBPwFX/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAgEBPwE//8QAFxABAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACIP/aAAgBAQAGPwKAWz//xAAbEAACAwADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAQMSFRcf/aAAgBAQABPyEpENnAgX3CJqG/K//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQZ+//xAAXEQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREh/9oACAEDAQE/EJ1Z/8QAFxEBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERUf/aAAgBAgEBPxCNW//EABwQAQACAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExEEFxgf/aAAgBAQABPxBGDBZY2BXSjrvBv7ErqvJv5n//2Q=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"v17a03img\"\n        title=\"v17a03img\"\n        src=\"/static/93770bcd87b5a77fcfb37972db8d60d0/4b190/v17a03img.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/93770bcd87b5a77fcfb37972db8d60d0/e07e9/v17a03img.jpg 200w,\n/static/93770bcd87b5a77fcfb37972db8d60d0/066f9/v17a03img.jpg 400w,\n/static/93770bcd87b5a77fcfb37972db8d60d0/4b190/v17a03img.jpg 800w,\n/static/93770bcd87b5a77fcfb37972db8d60d0/e5166/v17a03img.jpg 1200w,\n/static/93770bcd87b5a77fcfb37972db8d60d0/ac99c/v17a03img.jpg 1536w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Message from Active Minds","author":"Sriya Sadhu, Saathwik Saladi, and Alexei Ukraintsev","volume":17,"date":"September 13, 2020","topic":"Mental Health","slug":"/ballot-buzz/v17a03"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ballot-buzz/v17a03"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
