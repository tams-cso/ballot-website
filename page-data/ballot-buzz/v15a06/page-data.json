Throughout the book, we see them grow from boys to men to soldiers. Achilles, with all his athletic prowess, has a prophecy to fulfill and Patroclus is just along for the ride. Throughout the book, we see how deep Achilles and Patroclus’ bond is because their relationship was truly the driving point of The Iliad. I won’t say anything else about the plot because I don’t want to spoil it (even though I’m not sure if I can spoil the Iliad). In addition to a dynamic cast of characters and an amazingly detailed look at The Trojan War, this book also has some of the best writing I’ve read in a long time. The story is told in a lyrical style, in the perspective of Patroclus as he lives through one of the most devastating love stories of history.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ballot's Books - The Song of Achilles","author":"Yashvini Deva","volume":15,"date":"August 23, 2020","topic":"Book Review","slug":"/ballot-buzz/v15a06"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ballot-buzz/v15a06"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
