It’s an easy read filled with small-town action and stories from the past that I think everyone will enjoy. In Moon Over Manifest, Vanderpool scales in on Abilene Tucker who moves to Manifest, Kansas, with nothing but a compass and a satchel for the summer while her dad works a railroad job. Manifest, a town founded and run by immigrants and home to her dad when he was younger, is full of old memories and legends for Abilene and her friends to dig up. The story is told through Abilene in the 1930s, and flashes to Jinx, who used to live in Manifest around World War 1. Abilene and her friends fool around the entire summer stalking a local legend, hunting frogs, and doing odd-jobs around town. Through the help of Ms.Sadie the diviner, Abilene is able to piece together the mementos in her Lucky Bill Cigar box and learn more about her father while he was in Manifest. The book is filled with charming snippets of newspapers from the 1920s and ads for Billy Bump’s hair tonic. The story really comes full-circle in the end and if any of y’all read it let me know!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ballot's Books - Moon Over Manifest","author":"Jalini Balasubramaniam","volume":19,"date":"September 27, 2020","topic":"Book Review","slug":"/ballot-buzz/v19a04"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ballot-buzz/v19a04"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
