Known for his witty remarks and interviewing sensibilities, King was 87 years old at the time of his passing. Throughout his 25 year run, King has interviewed a variety of people, from celebrities such as Frank Sinatra to politicians such as Al Gore. He retired in 2010 after recording more than 6,000 episodes.</p>\n<p>While no clear cause of death was given, King was hospitalized with COVID-19 in late December, and has suffered from a number of health ailments from a string of heart attacks throughout the 1980s to lung cancer in 2017.</p>\n<p>Shortly after his passing, the family of Larry King released this statement:</p>\n<p>“We are heartbroken over our father's death, and together with our extended family mourn his passing. The world knew Larry King as a great broadcaster and interviewer, but to us he was 'dad.' He was the man who lovingly obsessed over our daily schedules and our well-being, and who took such immense pride in our accomplishments -- large, small, or imagined. And, through it all, we knew without a doubt in the world that he loved us more than life itself. He was an amazing father, and he was fiercely loyal to those lucky enough to call him a friend. We will miss him every single day of our lives.</p>\n<p>“The outpouring of love and the remembrances of his remarkable career have touched us deeply and we are so thankful. In lieu of flowers, we kindly ask consideration of a donation to the American Heart Association or the Beverly Hills Fire Department EMS, to which a debt of gratitude is owed for the wonderful care they provided to our dad in his final years.</p>\n<p>“With deep appreciation, Larry King, Jr., Chance King, and Cannon King”</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Larry King Passes at 87","author":"Daniel Li","volume":26,"date":"January 31, 2021","topic":"Other","slug":"/ballot-buzz/v26a02"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ballot-buzz/v26a02"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
