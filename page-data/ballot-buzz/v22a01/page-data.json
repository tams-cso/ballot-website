This was met with protests from people who believed Trump’s loss was the result of voter fraud.</p>\n<p>In Lansing, Michigan, Trump supporters peacefully gathered outside the Michigan State Capitol waving around signs that said “It’s not over” and chanting things like “we won” and “four more years.” A woman there claimed that “election integrity is a cornerstone of society that is crumbling away.” Pretty much the same thing went down in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. A protest at the Oregon State Capitol attracted the Oregon State Police and four protestors ended up arrested.</p>\n<p>Trump posted a tweet where he said, “I WON THE ELECTION, GOT 71,000,000 LEGAL VOTES.” That tweet was later fact-checked and flagged by Twitter. In this claim, legal votes refer to the ballots that weren’t cast through mail-in. Trump’s administration filed lawsuits against Georgia and Michigan over alleged voter fraud, but those lawsuits were quickly rejected by judges. On Saturday after Biden won the election, Trump filed a lawsuit in Arizona claiming in-person ballots marked with Sharpie were mistakenly rejected.</p>\n<p>Aside from that, this year’s presidential election had the largest voter turnout percentage-wise since 1900. The 1900 election had a turnout of 73.7% while this year’s election had a turnout of 66.9%. Kamala Harris also became the first woman and person of color to be vice president-elect.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Election Upset","author":"Temi Akinyoade","volume":22,"date":"November 08, 2020","topic":"2020 Presidential Election","slug":"/ballot-buzz/v22a01"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ballot-buzz/v22a01"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
