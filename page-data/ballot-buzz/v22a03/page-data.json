For one, mail ballots take longer for election officials to count because they require additional verification. This delay can cause speculations and misinformation to be spread even before the results are final, because partisans can make false claims about the results. For example, there have been false rumors of vote counts shooting up in the swing states, false assertions of ballots being lost/suddenly found, and allegations of sharpie markers messing up vote counts. These are some illegitimate suppositions made by voters to defend the outcomes as they are piling in.</p>\n<p>Additionally, another ludicrous publication, was a YouTube video claiming that the Democrats were committing voter fraud against Republican ballots; tiktok, facebook, and instagram are other examples of apps where people take advantage of their freedom and make fallacious statements regarding the ambivalent outcome of this election. So far, Joe Biden sustains an overall Electoral College lead after winning Midwestern battlegrounds like Wisconsin and Michigan. The media had a huge influence on these results, though. Saying Biden would win by a blowout and also taking into consideration how inaccurate the polls were, the media has lost trust in millions of Americans.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Potential Spread of Misinformation in the 2020 Election","author":"Sanjana Bolnedi","volume":22,"date":"November 08, 2020","topic":"2020 Presidential Election","slug":"/ballot-buzz/v22a03"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ballot-buzz/v22a03"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
