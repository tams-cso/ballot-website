Following the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, by police officers in Minneapolis and the killings of Breonna Taylor and Tony McDade by police in Florida, protests have erupted across our country to show support and solidarity.</p>\n<p>Before deciding to join a protest near you, it is also important to consider that there are many other ways to contribute to the cause. Feeling unsafe or being physically unable to protest doesn’t have to limit your ability to make a difference - you can donate money, contact legislators, and do much more as well.</p>\n<p>That being said, the right to protest falls under the First Amendment in our Constitution, and it’s important to keep this in mind as police across the nation have responded with unnecessary force. This small list of do’s and don’ts that can help provide some guidance applies to most protests, but we’ve also presented ways to stay safe during the global COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>Do Bring:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A Bag/Backpack</strong> - This backpack needs to be small, easily transportable, and durable. Avoid anything too bulky, but it should be big enough to carry all of your essential items.</li>\n<li><strong>Water</strong> - Especially in the case where your protest includes marches and chants (the most common), it’s important to stay hydrated as temperatures climb nationwide. Water can also be used to clean wounds and flush the eyes of anyone hit with chemical gas or pepper spray.</li>\n<li><strong>A Facial Covering</strong> - Whether this is a face mask or a bandana, it’s important to have protective facial gear to decrease the chances of contracting COVID. Additionally, these coverings also have the benefit of hiding your identity from cameras and surveillance.</li>\n<li><strong>Suitable Clothing</strong> - It’s best to wear all black, both to show solidarity and to blend in with the crowd. It’s also recommended to cover any distinct personal features (tattoos, brightly colored/dyed hair, etc.). Additionally, make sure your clothes/shoes are comfortable and durable. Wearing hats/sunglasses can protect you from the sun while also helping to protect your identity.</li>\n<li><strong>Snacks</strong> - Protests can last for a full day, and be tiring as well. Pack lightweight, nutritious, protein-rich snacks. Energy bars and nuts are always good examples.</li>\n<li><strong>First Aid Kit w/Hand Sanitizer</strong> - Hand sanitizer is an essential item in today’s world, especially when you could find yourself shaking hands with a stranger, etc. A basic First Aid kit can also come in handy in the case of any small injury (whether to yourself, or the people around you).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don’t Bring:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jewelry</strong> - It can easily be grabbed. Additionally, it is also very easy to lose valuable items in any kind of demonstration.</li>\n<li><strong>Contact Lenses</strong> - Contacts can trap irritating chemicals underneath it (harmful in the case of tear gas)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other Important Info:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t go to a protest if you don’t know what you’re fighting for! Especially if you are a non-black ally, study as much as possible about both the actions that you are protesting and the context around them.</li>\n<li>It’s also important to know your rights! Aside from the right to protest under the First Amendment, people also have the right to film/document whatever is happening in public space, and it can also be assumed that police don’t have the right to seize your notes or phone. If they end up doing so anyway, pursue legal action later on. However, the First Amendment doesn’t protect against unlawful activity (property destruction, assault, etc.)</li>\n<li>The question of whether or not to bring your phone to a protest is a complicated one. It’s best to leave your phone at home to protect your privacy and prevent surveillance (consider using a secondary phone, etc). If you do choose to bring your phone, avoid traditional phone calls and texts as much as possible, and opt for a 6-digit passcode instead of FaceID and fingerprint unlocking. Keep your phone and data turned OFF unless you absolutely need it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you are motivated by a specific call to action, like this one, you don’t need to end your involvement once the protest is over. You can always follow up with the organizers and ask if there’s any way you could help with pushing local leaders towards just policies. However, regardless of whether you choose to go out and protest or get involved in other ways, it’s always important to keep the safety of yourself and your loved ones in mind. Be careful, and stay safe!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to Protest Safely: The Dos and Don’ts of BLM Protesting in the Era of COVID","author":"Sriya Sadhu","volume":6,"date":"June 07, 2020","topic":"Black Lives Matter","slug":"/ballot-buzz/v06a03"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ballot-buzz/v06a03"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
