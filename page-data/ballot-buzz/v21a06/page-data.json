First of all, we would like to thank all of our readers, writers, and anyone that has helped us with this addition this year. It has been such a joy to read everyone's articles and we look forward to the Ballot Buzz continuing far beyond our own time at TAMS, though that isn't quite the purpose of this note (trust that you will receive a long and teary goodbye as the school year ends). The time is finally here - the long awaited, yet feared, November 3rd election day. This will be a stressful time for all of us, the results impacting many of our direct lives and future. If you are 18, you can vote all the way up to election day, so please go out and do so if you haven't! And, to most of us, being under 18 is extremely hard right now. We feel as if we don't have a say in the election that will be controlling our futures, arguably one of the most impacted groups by the results. We would like to urge everyone to not lose hope, regardless of the results. We will make it through whatever happens, despite the hardships that may await us in the future. If you feel your post-election emotions would best be shown through writing, we will be having a special issue next week over the results, and would be happy to accept any informative articles as well as opinion pieces or personal narratives. If you want company on election night, Shout! is hosting a judgement-free election night gala for open conversations and collective fear. And if you need to talk to anyone after the results, all of us Ballot Execs will be available to chat on messenger or Sesame call - just send us a message. Despite not living together in McConnell Hall, we are a family, and will all be here for each other. Stay safe this election day, and don't hesitate to reach out to anyone.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Note from the Ballot Execs","author":"The Ballot Execs","volume":21,"date":"November 01, 2020","topic":"Editorial","slug":"/ballot-buzz/v21a06"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ballot-buzz/v21a06"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
