However, through the summer, increasing reports of parties (densely packed and mask free) threaten to topple New York’s hard-earned stability.</li>\n<li>Gov. Andrew Cuomo states that the parties are “illegal” and that they “not only violate public health but violate human decency.”\n<ul>\n<li>The images of large raves in New York contrast heavily with the brutal spring they faced which left tens of thousands dead, again disproportionately impacting low-income communities with Black and Latino people.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Due to worries that nightlife activity might fuel further spread, led Cruaçao (an island country in the Caribbean) to close its bars and clubs for two weeks since Friday (ANP).

The Saturday afternoon deadline for forming a government was rolled over- this being more than a year and a half after the last government has collapsed.\n<ul>\n<li>The country has been operating with an emergency minority coalition throughout the coronavirus epidemic. However, Belgium has one of the highest COVID-19 death rates in the world.</li>\n<li>The country is polarized along regional and linguistic lines, making governing perpetually difficult.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This is now the longest period without a formal government in Belgian history. “I hope to form a government as soon as possible,” said Paul Magnette, the head of the French-speaking Socialists. “Our country needs it to effectively combat the epidemic, which sadly is rising again.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>COVID-19 cases stabilizing in Victoria, Australia due to strict lockdowns\n<ul>\n<li>The Australian government has reported on Saturday that the state of Victoria has begun to stabilize thanks to strict lockdown measures.</li>\n<li>A total of 446 new cases and 12 deaths were recorded Friday, according to Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews. Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton stated that the government's models showed the lockdown measures prevented about 20,000 cases.\n<ul>\n<li>Australia was held up as a global model in May for its handling of the outbreak, starting from early measures to barring entry from high-risk countries.</li>\n<li>As COVID-19 cases suddenly and recently rose in Victoria, authorities responded by instituting some of the most stringent movement restrictions in Australia's history.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>German virologists endorse mandatory masks in classrooms\n<ul>\n<li>As schools in Germany reopen after summer break, top virologists have urged mandatory maskwearing in schools, including during classroom lessons.</li>\n<li>In an open letter published on the website for the Society of Virology, the German virologists wrote, “Due to the real danger of infections between students who are asymptomatic, we urge strict maskwearing in all grades, including during lessons.”\n<ul>\n<li>The experts also recommend smaller learning groups to avoid too much cross-contact among students, increased measures for air circulation in classrooms, and a potential extension of winter break in case the coronavirus spikes during the winter season.“We are warning of the error to think that children do not play a role in the pandemic and infections. Such ideas are not in line with scientific data,” the virologists additionally wrote in their letter.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Official WHO Statistics</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Worldwide\n<ul>\n<li>New Cases - 104,868</li>\n<li>Confirmed Cases - 19,637,400</li>\n<li>Deaths - 725,871</li>\n<li>Recoveries - 12,615,426</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>United States of America\n<ul>\n<li>New Cases - 15,949</li>\n<li>Confirmed Cases - 5,111,473</li>\n<li>Deaths - 164,461</li>\n<li>Recoveries - 2,618,440</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Countries w/the most cases\n<ul>\n<li>United States of America</li>\n<li>Brazil</li>\n<li>India</li>\n<li>Russian Federation</li>\n<li>South Africa</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"COVID-19 World Update","author":"Sriya Sadhu","volume":13,"date":"August 09, 2020","topic":"COVID-19","slug":"/ballot-buzz/v13a03"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ballot-buzz/v13a03"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
