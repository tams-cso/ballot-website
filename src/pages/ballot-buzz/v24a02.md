Alex Trebek died at the age of 80 on November 8, 2020, after fighting pancreatic cancer for more than 18 months. Even though his struggle with pancreatic cancer has been long and arduous, it has not stopped him from doing amazing this. In honor of his passing away, let’s consider some of his most notable achievements.

* He won an Access Award from the American Foundation of the Blind.

Alex Trebek has been involved in philanthropy for almost the entirety of his career, but this award was actually not because of his charity work. In 1999, *Jeopardy!* had its first-ever blind contestant-- Eddie Timanus. To ensure that Eddie could compete fairly, accommodations were made. He was given a card with braille names for each category before the rounds and provided with a braille keyboard to type his name and final wager. In addition, all video clues were banned and the tradition of walking up to the podium was changed to contestants simply standing at the podium in the beginning. Eddie ended up winning five games until he retired undefeated and Alex Trebek won one of six annual Access Awards for his work in making *Jeopardy!* accessible.

* He has his own private charity.

Alex Trebek formed the Trebek Family Foundation in 2011 with his wife Jean, so that he could help more charities. They have donated to organizations such as St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Friends of the University of Ottawa, Fordham University. In total, Trebek’s foundation has donated more than a million dollars to a variety of charities. Even outside his charity, Trebek has a long-standing history of charity work-- from dating acres of land to a conservatory to hosting the geography bee for years.

* He has hosted *Jeopardy!*.

Alex Trebek has hosted *Jeopardy!* for 36 years. From 1984 to 2020, Trebek has hosted a total of 37 seasons and 9,200 episodes. For his work, he was won five Emmys and holds the record for the most episodes of a game show hosted. While on the show, he guest starred for other shows like How I Met Your Mother, but his primary focus was hosting *Jeopardy!*.

Throughout his life, Alex Trebek has done so much. May it be winning awards, donating to charities, or bringing us *Jeopardy!*, Trebek has made the world a better place by being in it.
