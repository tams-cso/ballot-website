The 100-day pause on deportations was part of the immigrant enforcement plans during Biden’s campaign. He had also proposed an immigration bill that would allow an estimated 11 million people in the U.S. to go from illegal to legal immigrants. But on January 22nd, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued and filed a complaint against the Biden administration for this. That ruling didn’t require deportations to continue at their prior pace, but as of February 1st, ICE had deported a few hundred people to Jamaica, Guatemala, and Honduras. It has been said that the Biden administration has deported over 26,000 people since the start of his presidency, but it’s unclear how many of those deportations happened from the public health deportation order Trump invoked that Biden decided to keep. ICE data says there has been around 28,700 deportations during 2021, but that includes data from since October.

On February 24th, a Texas federal judge put an indefinite pause to the deportation moratorium. It’s unknown whether Biden will appeal this ruling or not.
