Growing up, I often saw myself in the books I read. Whether it be Percy Jackson or The Fault in our Stars, I saw myself in the characters and found myself along the way. This is why I stand firmly with the idea that it is important for young people to see themselves reflected in the literature that they consume. Below is a short list of YA books reflecting mental health that I enjoyed and I hope you will too!
