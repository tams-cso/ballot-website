WIth the start of TAMS in just one day, most people are understandably stressing over the unknown right now. How will my online classes go? Will I get good grades? What if I can't study from home? While those fears are very real, Ballot has compiled a list of tips that can hopefully put most of them at ease. We hope you all have a great first day!
* Even if a class is asynchronous, set your own time to watch the lectures/review the material. This is a great way to hold yourself accountable.
* It can be really tempting to do something else during your live lectures, but try your best to stay engaged in the class. Trust me, you’ll definitely have a much easier time when it comes to studying for your tests. A great way I stay engaged is by taking really detailed notes during the class, so I’m forced to pay attention.
* As tempting as it may seem, don’t attend your lectures from bed. More often than not, you’ll probably fall asleep or get distracted. If you can, I would highly suggest setting up a space in your room/house where you only do work. This also helps you establish a work-life balance.
* Try to set mini goals while studying to reward yourself! For some people, that means rewarding themselves with candy when they finish reading a page, or something else!
* White music playlists can help drown out excess noise from your house but aren’t as distracting as actual songs when it comes to doing work.
* If you put TV on in the background while you study, try putting on a show you’ve already watched rather than one you are watching for the first time. That way your attention isn’t as split with following the new developments in the show and working on your classwork.
* If you find yourself in a study slump, don’t hesitate to take a break. Try calling a friend, eating a quick snack, or watching a youtube video.
* Try taking a sloppy set of notes when you watch your lectures for the first time, and then going back and revising them when you are studying later. It feels more like organizing them than actually studying, but it helps you retain the information better and actually understand what everything says.
* To-do apps will probably become your best friend as the year progresses. We love Todoist, but any app is great for remembering all the little things and having them all at the tip of your finger.
* When making a study schedule, try to set aside time for inevitable setbacks so when you get back on schedule you aren't as stressed about sticking to the plan you made. Allotting an extra 5-10 minutes per assignment also ensures that if you have any extra time, you can take a quick break and give yourself a
mental rest.
