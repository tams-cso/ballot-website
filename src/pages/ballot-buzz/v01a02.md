The CARES Act originally included $13 billion grant for the USPS but, after the President's decision, it was removed and changed to a $10 billion loan, which will have to be repaid. USPS Union Leader Mark Dimondstein has publicly stated that the USPS is in a situation where they may run out of money by September, and operations will likely cease if they don't receive sufficient funding, saying that the "Post Office is the civic life of the country."
