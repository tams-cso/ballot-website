In honor of Father’s Day, we decided to look back in time at the “fathers” who inspired the many great movements that brought equality. Although they themselves may not have children, the work they did birthed opportunities to many. Today, on Father’s Day, we want to celebrate the fathers of our society. Through their hardships and accomplishments, these trailblazers and their movements are in essence, very similar to a father and his child.

<div align="center"><b>Frederick Douglass</b></div>
<div align="center"><i>"Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.”“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.”“Those who profess to favor freedom, and yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground.”</i></div><br />

Born in 1818, Separated as an infant from his slave mother, Frederick lived with his grandmother on a Maryland plantation until he was eight years old. Defying a ban on teaching slaves to read and write, Baltimore slaveholder Hugh Auld’s wife Sophia taught Douglass the alphabet when he was around 12. Through his literacy, Douglass began to read newspapers, political writings, and literature. Through this, his ideological opposition to slavery began to take shape. As an antislavery lecturer, Douglass was asked to tell his story at abolitionist meetings. During this time, he published his first autobiography.

In order to evade recapture, He sailed to Liverpool, and eventually ended up in Ireland. He remained in Ireland and Britain for two years, speaking to large crowds on the evils of slavery. During this time, Douglass’ British supporters gathered funds to purchase his legal freedom. In 1847, Douglass was freed and returned to America.

Upon his return, Douglass produced the abolitionist newspapers: The North Star, Frederick Douglass Weekly, Frederick Douglass' Paper, Douglass' Monthly and New National Era. The motto of The North Star was "Right is of no Sex – Truth is of no Color – God is the Father of us all, and we are all brethren."
