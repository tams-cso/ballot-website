The Penelopiad, by Margaret Atwood, details the story of Penelope, the wife of Odysseus, through the famed Iliad and the Odyssey. I recommend it as the perfect read for anyone that has recently finished reading The Song of Achilles, a Percy Jackson reread, or anyone that loves hearing retellings of famous greek tales. I found my every notion of Penelope challenged through reading her version of her story, and her voice as a narrator is both humorous and thoughtful at the same time. Although I didn’t know too much of Penelope’s original story going in, The Penelopiad does an incredible job of both recapping the old view of her while putting into perspective the realities of the story to give the reader a new view of her character as a whole. The book isn’t a long read, only about 230 pages, and is a great book to read before heading to sleep or if you have random spots of free time scattered throughout the day. As always, if you read The Penelopiad be sure to reach out and let us know for a full analysis courtesy of our execs!
