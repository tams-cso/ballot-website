Dear ex-seniors and brand new graduates, 

First off, congratulations! You made it through twelve years of the American education system and that is no small feat. Through these years, you have all grown from children to capable adults who are ready to change the world. I am lucky to say I have had the privilege to know quite a few of you and while I am sad to see you go, I know it is for better things. This year may not have ended with you walking across a physical stage, but even in spite of this, your class has built entire universities in Minecraft and held countless ceremonies on Zoom. These last few months have been tough, but you have shown us and the whole world that you are capable of handling anything it throws at you. I canâ€™t wait to see your name in the news next to headlines for big things one day.

Wishing you all the best of luck, Yashvini
